## These are some notes for the Udacity git/version control course.
## They want us to write crap down. Shrug.

## Lesson 1

## $diff -u brought out some differences between two files. The diff output is a little weird to parse but that's probably because I don't look at it often.

## It shows '+' or '-' to denote differences between the files compared, e.g.

	- some stuff that was in the first file but not the second
	+ vice-versa

## It'll do this for even a snp or something, the whole old line is marked as gone a new line added with a single change.

## Having multiple versions will probably help playing with different bits of various programs in the future.

## Manual commits vs autosave, they try to say manual is better. Probly is!
